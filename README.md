# earthquake-archive
Fetches all earthquakes by year as reporeted by the USGS.  Output is to a CSV file.

Modify these lines to set your start/end range.  

```
# Your range
YEAR_START=2017
YEAR_END=2017
```

If you simply need one year, make them the same value.

For example, if you want all earthquakes from 2000 to 2020, you would use:

```
# Your range
YEAR_START=2000
YEAR_END=2020
```
